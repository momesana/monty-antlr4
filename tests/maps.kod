# A map is a collection providing a key-to-value mapping. A key therefore has to
# be unique. For each key, there can only be one value. Also, the order of the
# entries is not defined.

let names := {
	0: "Neil Caffrey",
	1: "Peter Burke"
}

# Add one element.
names.add(2, "Linus Torvalds")

# Similarly, the index operator could be used.
names[2] := "Linus Torvalds"

# add() is overloaded and may also take a map.
names.add({}) # Do not add anything.
names.add({2: "Linus Torvalds", 3: "Bill Gates"})

# Adding one or more elements using the + operator (does not modify the original
# map).
let names2 := names + { 2: "Linus Torvalds" }
