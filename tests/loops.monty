# Constructs a list with elements from 2 to 5.
for i in [2..5]:
	print(i)

# Equivalent:
for i in [2..5]: print(i)

# From 1 to 100 in steps of 5.
for i in [1..100].step(5):
	print(i)

# Alternatively:
for i in Range(1, 100, 5):
	print(i)

# Define a list of tuples.
let users := [
	("Peter", "Burke"),
	("Neil", "Caffrey")
]

# Then, use tuple unpacking in the signature of the for-loop:
for (firstName, lastName) in users:
	println("$firstName.$lastName")

# Zipping lists:
let ages := [1, 2]
for (name, age) in users.zip(ages):
	n := name.join(" ")
	println("$n: $age")

# Infinite lists and iterators can be zipped as well:
for (a, b) in [1..].zip([3..]):
	println(a, b)
